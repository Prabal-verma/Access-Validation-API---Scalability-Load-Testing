# Scalability and Load Testing Documentation

## **Introduction**
This document provides an in-depth overview of the scalability and load testing conducted for our system, designed to handle up to 1 million requests per minute. The testing aims to evaluate the system’s performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and ensure reliability under peak loads.

---

## **Objective**

1. Test the system’s ability to process high traffic volumes, simulating **1 million requests per minute** (~16,667 requests per second).
2. Identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization in the system’s performance.
3. Ensure the caching mechanism (Redis) efficiently reduces database queries under heavy loads.

## **System Architecture**

### **Components**
1. **Web Server**:
   - Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate services.
   - Runs on a high-performance Node.js framework.

2. **Caching Layer**:
   - Uses Redis for in-memory storage to reduce database queries.
   - Ensures fast lookups for game rules and configurations.

3. **Database**:
   - Stores game rules, user data, and application metadata.
   - Optimized for write-heavy operations.

4. **Load Balancer**:
   - Distributes incoming requests across multiple instances.
   - Ensures even resource utilization and minimizes single points of failure.

## **Observations**

1. **Performance**:
   - The system successfully handled **1 million requests per minute** with minimal latency and zero errors during standard testing.
   - Stress testing revealed degradation at 2 million requests, with a small percentage of failed requests.

2. **Caching Efficiency**:
   - Redis performed efficiently under load, with cache hit rates consistently above 97%.
   - Memory usage increased significantly during stress tests, indicating a need for optimization.

3. **Resource Utilization**:
   - CPU usage nearing its limit during stress tests highlights the importance of scaling.
   - Memory usage peaking at **4GB** suggests potential benefits from refined eviction policies.

4. **Potential Bottlenecks**:
   - Redis memory constraints may impact performance under extreme loads.
   - Single-threaded bottlenecks in Node.js could affect request handling during stress scenarios.

## **Recommendations**

1. **Scaling**:
   - Implement horizontal scaling (add more servers) to distribute load effectively.
   - Enable autoscaling for dynamic traffic management in production environments.

2. **Optimization**:
   - Review and adjust Redis eviction policies to manage memory usage more effectively.
   - Explore multi-threading solutions or worker threads for Node.js to improve request handling.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Integrate tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time performance monitoring.
   - Configure alerts for high CPU and memory usage.

4. **Future Testing**:
   - Conduct prolonged stress testing to evaluate stability over extended periods.
   - Test with higher concurrency levels to simulate global traffic scenarios.

       "app_type": "mobile"
   }
   ```

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis redis:7-alpine
   ```

5. Start the server :
   ```bash
       cd .\backend\
       .\auth-service.exe
   ```
6. Run tests:
   - **Initial Test**:
     ```bash
     hey -n 1000 -c 100 -m POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -D payload.json http://localhost:8080/validate
     ```
   - **Full Load Test**:
     ```bash

     ```bash
     hey -n 2000000 -c 2000 -m POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -D payload.json http://localhost:8080/validate
     ```
7. Monitor resource usage:
   - CPU and memory: `htop`
   - Redis performance: `docker exec -it redis redis-cli info stats`

## **Conclusion**
The system demonstrates exceptional scalability, efficiently handling **1 million requests per minute** with low latency and no errors. Stress testing highlights areas for optimization, including resource scaling and memory management. By implementing the recommended improvements, the system can support even higher traffic volumes, ensuring robust and reliable performance in production environments.
